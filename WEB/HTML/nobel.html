According  to  the  estimate  by  Machta  (1971),  the
concentration of carbon dioxide   in   the   atmosphere may increase as much as 20% during the latter half of this century as a result of fossil fuel combustion.
It has been speculated that an increase in the CO2 content in the atmosphere may  result  in  the  gradual rise of the atmospheric temperature (Callendar, 1949). Plass (1956), Kaplan (1960) and Kondratiev and Niilisk (1960) estimated the increase of  the  tempera­ ture of the earth's surface required  to  compensate  for the increase in the  downward  terrestrial  radiation  due to the increase in the CO2 content in the atmosphere. According to Plass, the  doubling  or  halving  of the CO2  results  in  a  temperature  change  of  +3.8°C  or
- 3.6°C, respectively. Kaplan (1960) attempted to improve  Plass' estimate  by  taking  into consideration the effect of cloudiness, as well as by improving the computation scheme of radiative transfer.  Kondratiev and Niilisk (1960) considered the effect of overlapping between the 15-µm  band  of  CO2  and the rotation band of water vapor. The magnitudes of the  tempera­ ture changes estimated by both Kaplan,  and  Kon­ dratiev and Niilisk are significantly less than those estimated by Plass, indicating the importance of such factors as cloudiness and overlapping between bands in this problem.

Moller (1963) reviewed these studies critically and tried to improve these estimates by making a more realistic assumption. According to Moller, the atmo­ sphere tends to restore a certain climatological dis­ tribution of relative  humidity in response to the change of t emperature . The change in surface tem­ perature is accomplished by a change in air  tempera­ ture, which in turn causes the changes in absolute humidity of air and in the downward terrestrial radiation. The change in absolute humidity also affects absorption  of solar radiation  and,
<br><br>
accordingly, the amount of solar radiation reaching  the earth's surface. Taking into consideration all these factors, Moller reevaluated the effect of the increase of carbon dioxide content upon the temperature of the earth's surface.  To  his  surprise,   he  obtained  results  which are quite different from those of the earlier studies mentioned above. According to his estimate, an  in­ crease in the water vapor content of  the   atmosphere with rising temperature causes a self-amplifying effect which results in an almost arbitrary temperature change. For example, when the  air  temperature  is around 15°C,  the  doubling  of  CO2 content  results  in an increase of temperature by as much as  10°C.  For other air temperatures, the result may be completely different.
Examining Moller's method, Manabe and Wetherald (1967) felt that it was necessary to take into con­ sideration another physical factor in order to obtain reasonable results. They maintained that the change
in CO2 content not only affects the flux of net radia­ tion at the earth's surface but also the fluxes of sen­ sible and latent heat from the earth's surface to the atmosphere. In order to find out how the flux of total
heat energy depends upon the CO2 content, it is necessary to take into consideration  the heat balance of the atmosphere as well as that of the earth's sur­ face. Therefore, Manabe and Wetherald proposed to use a one-dimensional model of radiative-convective
equilibrium to investigate this problem. By comparing the state of radiative-convective equilibrium which was obtained for various CO2 concentrations, they esti­ mated the dependence of atmospheric temperature upon CO2 concentration. Following the suggestion of Moller, they incorporated into their model the mecha­ nism of the water vapor greenhouse feedback by assum­ ing a fixed distribution of relative (rather than absolute) humidity in the model atmosphere. Although their results show that the water vapor greenhouse  feed back is responsible for increasing  the sensitivity  of the temperature  of  the model  atmosphere,  it  does not yield  an indefinite  result such  as  that obtained by Moller. They found that the doubling of CO2 in
the air increases the equilibrium temperature of the earth's surface by about 2.3°C provided that  no change in cloudiness takes place. Manabe (1971) at­ tempted to improve this result further by replacing his scheme of computing radiative transfer with the method of Rodgers and Walshaw (1966) as modified by Stone and Manabe (1968). In this case, he ob­ tained a somewhat smaller increase of about 1.9°C resulting from the doubling of carbon dioxide content. Rasool and Schneider (1971) also estimated the thermal effects of a change in the concentration of CO2 based upon the consideration of the heat balance of the atmosphere. It turned out that the change in surface temperature which they estimated is much smaller than the change obtained by Mana.be and Wetherald.  According   to  our  more  recent  studies, a significant part of the difference stems from the
following:effects:
<br>
<br>
1)	Rasool and Schneider did not take into considera­ tion the fact that the temperature change in the stratosphere has an opposite sign to that in the troposphere.
2)	The absorption of solar ra.diation is altered if the atmospheric temperature and accordingly also the water vapor content changes, This factor was not considered by Rasool and Schneider.
<br>
<br>
The models of Rasool and Schneider (1971) and Manabe and Wetherald (1967) are globally averaged models, However, the climate of the planet Earth · is maintained by·the nonlinear coupling between various processes, such as the poleward heat transfer by the atmospheric and oceanic circulations, as well as the vertical heat transfer by radiative transfer and con-
<br>
<br>
ection, Thus, it is clear that one cannot obtain a definitive conclusion, using a globally averaged model, concerning the effect of an increase in CO2 upon climate. Recently, Budyko (1969) and Sellers (1969) constructed a very simple model of the atmosphere in which the effects of a, poleward heat transport as well as radiative transfer were included although in highly parameterized forms. In addition, they incor­ porated into their model the following positive feed­ back mechanism that would tend to enhance the sensitivity of the model climate:
decrease (increase) of atmospheric temperature
-wider (narrower) area of snow cover or ice pack
-larger (smaller) albedo of earth's surface
-decrease (increase)  of  atmospheric temperature.
<br>
<br>
By using their model, Budyko and Sellers suggested that the thermal regime of the model atmosphere is highly sensitive to small changes in various parame­ ters, such as the solar constant, when the process of the snow cover feedback is incorporated. Their study suggests that it is important to consider this feedback mechanism for our problem. Since the heat transport by large-scale eddies is parameterized in an extremely simple man er and many idealizations are made in their model, it is clear that we need a better model for a quantitative study of the climatic change result­ ing from an increase of .the amount of CO2 in the atmosphere.
The present study represents a preliminary attempt
to do this by using a three-dimensional general circula­ tion model in which the heat transport by large-scale eddies is computed explicitly rather than by parame­ terization. The long-term integrations of the model are carried out for two different concentrations of CO2, i.e., the present and twice the present concentration. By comparing the two quasi-equilibrium states which emerge from these experiments, we will evaluate how the concentration affects the state of the model atmosphere.
It should be noted here  that  a sensitivity  study such as described in this paper is meaningful provided that the following conditions are sat isfied,
<br><br>
(i)	The model has a stable equilibrium climate.<br><br>
(ii)	An external forcing (such as the doubling of CO2 concentration) is not large enough to force the model climate out of the stable equilibrium into a markedly different state.
Obviously, it is useful to inquire how large an external forcing is required in order to push the model climate out of stable equilibrium or how the model climate changes thereafter. However, it is not the subject of the present study.
In view of the many simplifications adopted for the
construction of the model, the result from this study should not be regarded as a definitive study of this problem. Instead, we are satisfied if this study yields
some valuable insight into the physical factors which control the response of the atmosphere to the change in the carbon dioxide content in the atmosphere.

2.	Description of the model
The  general  circulation  model  used  for  this  study is essentially the same as that described by Manabe (1969). Therefore, only a brief description of the  model is given here.
The model solves the primitive equations on a Mer­ cator projection using an  energy  conserving  form  of the finite-difference formulation. The vertical coordi­ nate is defined by pressure normalized by surface pressure.  To  simulate  the  effects of  subgrid  mixing, a nonlinear viscosity is included in the model. The topography adopted is the same as that described by Manabe  (1969).  Free-slip  insulated  walls  are  placed at the equator and at 81.7N, whereas cyclic continuity is  assumed  for  the  two  meridional   boundaries  120° of   longitude  apart.  Grid-point  spacing  is  such  that the resolution is approximately 500 km. Nine vertical levels are chosen so that the model can simulate the structure of both the stratosphere and the planetary boundary layer. The computational domain is divided into two equal areas  up  to  66.5N  latitude,  continent and "ocean," respectively. From 66.5N to the polar boundary  at  81.7N,  continent  is assumed  throughout. A diagram of the  computational  region  is shown  in Fig. 1.  It  should  be  stressed  here  that  this  model does not contain a separate ocean computation. The "ocean"  portion  is  simply  considered   to  be  an  area of wet  land  or  an  area  possessing  an  infinite source of soil moisture for evaporation. The model ocean resembles  the  actual  ocean  in  the  sense  that  it  is wet, but  it  lacks  the  effects  of  heat  transport  by ocean currents.
The scheme for computing radiative heating and cooling is described  by Manabe and Strickler  (1964) and Manabe  and  Wetherald (1967),  and  computes both solar and longwave radiation fluxes.2 The dis­ tribution of cloudiness is specified from annual mean observations and is a function of latitude and  height only. Three atmospheric gases are taken into account, i.e., water vapor, ozone and carbon dioxide. The dis­ tribution of water vapor is determined by the  prog­ nostic equations of the model or, in other words, the radiative computation is " coupled" with  the  hydro­ logic cycle. The spatial distribution of ozone is specified in  a  manner  analogous  to  clouds.  The  mixing  ratio of  carbon dioxide is taken to be constant everywhere. The surface temperature over the continent and the hypothetical ocean is determined from the boundary condition that no heat is stored  at  the earth's surface, i.e., net fluxes of solar and terrestrial radiation and
the turbulent fluxes of sensible and latent heat locally sum to zero.
<br>
<br>
The prognostic system of water vapor involves the three-dimensional advection of water vapor, evapora­ tion, vertical mixing, nonconvective   condensation, and an idealized moist convective adjustment. Over continental surfaces, the depth of snow cover and the amount of soil moisture are based upon detailed balance computations of snow and soil moisture, respectively. In  particular, the snow depth is increased by snowfall and depleted by evaporation  and  snow­ melt. The latter quantity is computed from the re­ quirement  of  the heat  balance  when  conditions  for the  snowmelt  are  satisfied.  [See  Manabe  (1969)  for
further description of the prognostic system of soil moisture and snow.J  Differentiation between   rain or
snow  is  determined   by  the  temperature  at  a  height of  approximately  350 m. If  this  temperature  is equal to less than 0°C, precipit ation is in the form of snow; otherwise, it occurs in the form of rain.  Over  the oceanic region, the area of sea ice is identified  as the area where  the  surface  temperature  over  the  ocean is less than - 2°C.
For the computation of  the heat  balance  at the earth's surface, it is necessary  to  know  the  distribu­ tion of  surface  albedo.  It  is assumed  that  the albedo of  the  soil  surface  is a function  of  latitude  and  that its distribution with  latitude  is the  same  as  that  used by Manabe  (1969).  The  albedos of  snow  cover  and sea ice are assumed  to  be much larger  than the albedo of bare soil. As"pointed out in the Introduction, this difference in albedo accounts for the snow cover feedback.
<br>
<br>
Both snow cover and sea ice are classified into two categories, i.e., permanent and temporary snow cover (sea ice). Different values of  albedo  are assigned  to each category. Referring to the study  of Budyko (1956), unstable snow cover and unstable sea ice are assigned an albedo of 0.45 and 0.35, respectively, whereas both permanent  snow  cover  and  permanent sea ice are assigned a common albedo of 0.70. The discrimination between the permanent and temporary snow cover (sea ice) is made according to the surface

resulting from the specific choice of initial conditions, another integration is carried out starting from quite different initial conditions, which are described in Appendix B. The final state of equilibrium is now obtained by  averaging  the two  100-day  mean  states. In order to attain a satisfactory convergence toward statistical equilibrium, it is necessary  to carry out the time integration for sufficiently long periods. The degree of convergence obtained by the procedure de­ scribed above is evident in Fig. 3. This figure shows
<br>
<br>
how the (mass-weighted) mean temperature of the model atmosphere changes with time  starting  from the two initial conditions. Note that the initial values for the. two runs are considerably different from one another, but that they are practic;1lly indistinguishable toward the end of the runs. The difference between the two mean temperatures averaged over the  last 100 days of each integra tion is about 0.10°C. For a further discussion of the convergence of the solution, see Appendix B.

4.	Doubling of CO2 concentration
This section deals with the comparison between the two statistical equilibrium states corresponding to the present and twice the present concentration of CO2. For ease of identification, the case of the present concentration is identified as the "standard" case and that of double concentration as the "2XCO2" case. Unless we specify otherwise, the results presented here are obtained by taking the average of two time-mean states, which are computed from the last 100-day period of each integration as described in the pre­ ceding section.

a.	Temperature
The latitude-height distribution of the zonal mean temperature in the model atmosphere with a normal concentration of carbon dioxide is shown in Fig. 4a. According to  the  comparison  between  this result and the  distribution  of observed  annual  mean  tempera­ ture 4 the thermal structure of the model atmosphere gen;rally resembles that of the actual atmosphere. However, the  surface  temperature in the model  tropics is  significantly higher than   the  observed   value  due to the lack of the poleward transport of heat by ocean currents  (see  Fig.  5  also).  In  the  lower  stratosphere of the model, the zonal mean temperature in middle latitudes is significantly colder than  observed.  The failure of the model  to  produce  the  relatively  warm belt in the lower stratosphere of the middle latitudes seems to be a characteristic  of  the limited  domain model which cannot  accommodate  ultra-long  waves (see Manabe, 1969).
Fig. 4b shows the difference in zonal mean tem­ perature between the 2 CO2 and the standard case.
